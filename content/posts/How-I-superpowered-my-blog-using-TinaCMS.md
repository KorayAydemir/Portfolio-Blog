I can't count the amount of times I've tried many content management systems like SanityCMS and Strapi. The challenging thing always was achieving the true WYSIWYG  experience on browsers.

TinaCMS makes it astonishingly easy for both developers and clients.

First of all, it gives you rehydrating of the page out of the box

```graphql
useTina()
```
